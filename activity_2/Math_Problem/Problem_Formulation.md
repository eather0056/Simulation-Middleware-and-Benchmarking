### Math Problem:

A company gives bonuses to its employees based on their years of service and performance rating. The rules are as follows:
- If an employee has worked for 5 or more years and has a performance rating of "Excellent", they get a bonus of $1000.
- If the employee has worked for 5 or more years and has a performance rating of "Good", they get a bonus of $500.
- If the employee has worked for less than 5 years but has a performance rating of "Excellent", they get a bonus of $300.
- All other employees get no bonus.

The program should ask the user for:
1. Their years of service.
2. Their performance rating (as a string: "Excellent", "Good", or "Poor").
